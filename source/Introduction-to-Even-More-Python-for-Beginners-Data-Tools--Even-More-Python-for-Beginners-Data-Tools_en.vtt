00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.360
>> Hi there. Welcome to yet
another Python series in

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.590
case you or sick of us
already we're back for more.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.230
This time we're going to focus in
on some tools for data science.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.835
Now, before we get into it,

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:19.290
there's really three main questions

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.805
that we want to be able to answer.

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:22.745
Who are we, who are you

00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:25.230
and what is it that we're
going to be doing here?

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.810
So let's start off
with, well, who are we?

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.960
>> So my name is Susan Ibach and I am

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.635
definitely a data geek also
known as hockeygeekgirl online,

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.450
and one of the things that
I loved to do when I'm

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.340
not sitting in front
of a terminal coding,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.200
I'm probably either maybe running

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.735
a marathon or maybe listening
some good thrash fan.

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:46.595
>> As for me, I'm
Christopher Harrison.

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:50.440
I've been a geek for about
as long as I can remember.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.270
I'm now a Program Manager at or with

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.425
academic ecosystems
inside of Microsoft,

00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:58.515
I've a propensity to tell dad jokes,

00:00:58.515 --> 00:00:59.670
as well as saying the word

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.300
"Propensity" I'm a
husband, I'm a marathoner,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.550
and I'm a father of
a four-legged child,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.275
also known as a dog.

00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:14.030
So let's talk a little bit
then about like expectations,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.710
prerequisites, if
you will, basically,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.720
who are you and why is

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.435
it that you might be interested
in something like this?

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:23.105
So the assumption that we're
making is that you've done

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:26.030
a little bit of Python
and you're looking to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.780
just get in and start to
explore data science that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.520
maybe there's a quick start
that you'll want to check

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.590
out and you're just trying
to figure out like,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.530
what are these different
things that I'm being told to

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.065
just follow along with
and just run some code.

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:45.420
Hopefully, we'll explain some of
what's going on inside of there.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.175
>> Yeah, because a lot of times,

00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:49.160
a lot of people get into
Python because I have

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.320
an interest in exploring
that world of data science,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.779
but opening up that first
data science tutorial,

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:56.480
you've got all the data science
concepts and at the same time

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.670
all kinds of new Python libraries

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.470
and debates that you might
not be familiar with.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.650
So what we're hoping here
is introduce you to some of

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.260
those Python tools and some of

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.730
those libraries so that maybe

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.350
when you do that data
science tutorial,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.140
you can focus more on just
new data science concepts.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.360
>> Yeah, so that's really what it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.930
is that we're going to be doing
here, is introducing those,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.640
those libraries, walk you

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.890
through some common
tools and techniques,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.080
and navigate through
some common scenarios.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.220
The way that we're going to
be doing it is by walking

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.054
through really some basic scenarios,

00:02:32.054 --> 00:02:34.130
and you'll notice that
there'll be a little bit of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.905
a common thread throughout
a lot of these modules,

00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:38.450
where a lot of these modules,

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.005
a lot of these concepts will
build on the ones prior.

00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:45.320
That being said, there still
all designed to be snackable,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.910
all just like really short.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.320
So you can jump in,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.830
take a look at the particular
tools concepts that you need,

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.465
and then jump back out from there.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.370
>> Yeah, but you'll find
it easiest to learn

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.990
these particular series if you
do watch them sequentially.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.270
You can still skip

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.980
the PowerPoint presentation and jump

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.930
straight to demos if you're one
of those people who are just,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.220
"Just show me the code in

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.440
action" You can still
absolutely do that,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.600
just follow the code modules,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.930
but you will probably
find easier to follow

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.210
the concepts if you do
the modules in order.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.005
>> Yes, so let's head on into it.

00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:17.800
>> Let's start coding.
